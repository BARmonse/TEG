- Always use camelCase
- Always answer in english, if you see text in spanish in the current code please replace it with its translation in english
- Always use Tailwind for styling
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Always review the instructions to see if the implementation is correct [TEG.pdf](mdc:teg-back/docs/assets/TEG.pdf). Let's focus on mandatory requirements first

- Always answer having in mind that I'm using JDK 17 for the api and Angular 19
- don't do this @RequestBody Map<String, Object> payload. Instead create the respective DTO.
